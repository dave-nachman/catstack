# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why should somebody learn Catstack?

Technologists have a lot to gain from learning and using different programming language paradigms. Even if a programmer doesn't end up using a programming language in their day-to-day projects, ways of thinking learned from one family of programming languages can often be applied to and influence thinking in others.

Stack and concatenative programming languages are such a paradigm — they are quite different than today's mainstream programming languages, but have insights to offer in terms of thinking about how to build programs through the composition and manipulation of functions.

Catstack is meant as a minimal version of such a language — helping users to extract the key insights by stripping away the non-essential.

### Should I use Catstack for real projects?

No, at least for now. Catstack is primarily meant as a tool to help technologists learn about stack-oriented programming languages.
