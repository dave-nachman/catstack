# Design choices

Catstack aims to be very minimal and consistent, in order to emphasize the fundamental characteristics of the stack-oriented programming model. It is designed to be what Scheme is intended to be compared to Lisp â€” a simple language that has only an essential set of concepts and distinctions.

### Consistency of syntax

Everything uses postfix evaluation, including defining new variables (e.g. `[x] 20 def`). All names are immediately evaluated.

### Unification of functions, quotations, and lists

Some stack-based programming languages have different concepts and syntax for functions, quotations, and lists.

For example, PostScript has the following:

```
{dup mul}    % procedure
\name        % name that won't be evaluated; instead pushed on stack
[1 2 3]      % array
```

Catstack has a single construct for each of these use cases, as list serve as a general mechanism for quotation. A list serves as the body of a function. Names are represented for definitional purposes as a list of a single name, rather than a special quoted value.

```
[dup mult]   # list serving as function definition
[square]       # list of a single name
[1 2 3]      # list of number values
```

Unifying these use cases together with a single construct simplifies the language, and secondarily may also promote metaprogramming

### Consistent evaluation of names

Catstack tries to evaluate a name regardless of whether it points to a list (i.e. function definition) or a literal value. If it is a literal value, an error is thrown. Catstack instead has a lookup operation (`@x` - place the literal value of `x` on the stack) which works the same regardless of whether the value is a list or literal.

By comparison, some other stack-based languages (e.g. Factor) will evaluate the value if it is a function definition but will push the literal value onto the stack if not.

Catstack doesn't change its behavior depending on whether the value is a list or literal in order to promote simple and consistent rules of evaluation.

### Lexical vs. Dynamic scoping

An important choice for programming languages is whether variable names refer to the environment at the point of definition (*lexical* or *static* scoping) or refer to the environment at the point where the code is run (*dynamic* scoping). Most modern programming languages use lexical scoping, but dynamic scoping is simpler to implement, often common in stack-based languages, and has some advantages for stack-based languages.

Catstack has dynamic scoping by default. For example, if you wrote `[add2] [2 add] def` and then changed the definition of `add`, `add2` would refer to the new definition of `add` if `add2` was invoked, because the value of add is looked up at the time of invocation. 

This has the benefit of creating a simple consistent programming model, but isn't always what the programmer would want. To address this, Catstack lets you introduce a *closure*, where a function definition is associated with a fixed environment. This provides a facility for lexical scoping, because it lets you freeze the environment. E.g. if you wrote `[add2] [2 add] close def`, and then changed the definition of `add`, `add2` would still refer to the prior definition of `add`.
